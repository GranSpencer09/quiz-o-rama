## Description
This quiz tests your knowledge of the San Francisco Giants. This quiz helped me learn more about my favorite baseball team as well as test my skills working with DOM and manipulating elements based off user's actions. It also tested my ability to have multiple functions running at once, like the score and time. Finally, it was a way to improve my understanding of localstorage.
With this quiz, you can be sure to impress your friends with how much you know about the Giants. As one of the most successful professional sports franchise, there's lots to know.

## Installation
Just open the link and run the application. Test your knowledge!

## Usage
See the screenshot above, but the app runs like most quizes. Click to start, answer as many questions as possible under the time limit and be sure to get them all right! Select the option you think is the right answer as the questions and answers cycle through. By answering the first question, the next one will appear. This repeats until you've answered every question, the quiz does not stop when the time reaches zero.

## Credits
I noted this in the HTML index file but I got lots of the structure from coding dojo and I worked with my tutor to get the Javascript logic right. I also pulled colors and trivia questions from the Giants website.
